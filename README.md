## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Iam Shipali!

I enjoy building things with code, exploring cybersecurity concepts, and trying out tools in cloud and web development. Whether it's a simple app, a research write-up, or just learning something new - I love getting hands-on and figuring things out.
Iam open to new opportunities, collaborations, or tech conversations - feel free to connect!
